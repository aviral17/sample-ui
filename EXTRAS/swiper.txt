Hello, this is Bing. I'm sorry to hear that you are having trouble with react swiper 11th version. I searched the web for some possible solutions to your problem.

One suggestion is to use the `breakpoints` prop to specify different settings for different screen sizes and zoom levels. This will allow you to adjust the number of slides per view and the space between them according to the device width and the device pixel ratioÂ¹. Your code would look like this:

```jsx
import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from "swiper/react";

return (
  <Swiper
    style={{ width: "100%" }}
    // install Swiper modules
    modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Scrollbar, A11y]}
    centeredSlides={true}
    spaceBetween={25}
    initialSlide={4}
    slidesPerView={5}
    // navigation
    // centeredSlidesBounds={true}
    // pagination={{ clickable: true }}
    scrollbar={{ draggable: true }}
    onSwiper={(swiper) => console.log(swiper)}
    onSlideChange={() => console.log("slide change")}
    breakpoints={{
      // when window width is >= 320px and device pixel ratio is <= 0.25
      "320-0.25": {
        slidesPerView: 1,
        spaceBetween: 10
      },
      // when window width is >= 320px and device pixel ratio is <= 0.5
      "320-0.5": {
        slidesPerView: 2,
        spaceBetween: 15
      },
      // when window width is >= 320px and device pixel ratio is <= 0.75
      "320-0.75": {
        slidesPerView: 3,
        spaceBetween: 20
      },
      // when window width is >= 320px and device pixel ratio is <= 1
      "320-1": {
        slidesPerView: 4,
        spaceBetween: 25
      },
      // when window width is >= 480px and device pixel ratio is <= 0.25
      "480-0.25": {
        slidesPerView: 2,
        spaceBetween: 15
      },
      // when window width is >= 480px and device pixel ratio is <= 0.5
      "480-0.5": {
        slidesPerView: 3,
        spaceBetween: 20
      },
      // when window width is >= 480px and device pixel ratio is <= 0.75
      "480-0.75": {
        slidesPerView: 4,
        spaceBetween: 25
      },
      // when window width is >= 480px and device pixel ratio is <= 1
      "480-1": {
        slidesPerView: 5,
        spaceBetween: 30
      },
      // when window width is >= 640px and device pixel ratio is <= 0.25
      "640-0.25": {
        slidesPerView: 3,
        spaceBetween: 20
      },
      // when window width is >= 640px and device pixel ratio is <= 0.5
      "640-0.5": {
        slidesPerView: 4,
        spaceBetween: 25
      },
      // when window width is >= 640px and device pixel ratio is <= 0.75
      "640-0.75": {
        slidesPerView: 5,
        spaceBetween: 30
      },
      // when window width is >= 640px and device pixel ratio is <= 1
      "640-1": {
        slidesPerView: 6,
        spaceBetween: 35
      }
    }}
  >
    {cardsData.map((card, index) => {
      const iconPath =
        liveTextIconMap[card.liveText as keyof typeof liveTextIconMap];

      const isThirdCard = index === 3;
      const isFourthCard = index === 4;
      const isFifthCard = index === 5 || index === 6;

      if (index === 4) {
        return (
          <SwiperSlide key={index}>
            <FlipCard
              key={index}
              card={card}
              icon={iconPath}
              isOpaque={index < 3}
              isFourth={isFourthCard}
              isFifth={isFifthCard}
              isThird={isThirdCard}
            />
          </SwiperSlide>
        );
      } else {
        return (
          <SwiperSlide key={index}>
            <Card
              key={index}
              {...card}
              icon={iconPath}
              isOpaque={index < 3}
              isFourth={isFourthCard}
              isFifth={isFifthCard}
              isThird={isThirdCard}
            />
          </SwiperSlide>
        );
      }
    })}
  </Swiper>
);
```

Another suggestion is to use the `resizeObserver` prop to enable the swiper to recalculate the size of the slides when the window is resized or zoomed. This will allow you to use the swiper without any extra code or hooks. You can read more about this prop in the [swiper documentation](^2^). Your code would look like this:

```jsx
import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from "swiper/react";

return (
  <Swiper
    style={{ width: "100%" }}
    // install Swiper modules
    modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Scrollbar, A11y]}
    centeredSlides={true}
    spaceBetween={25}
    initialSlide={4}
    slidesPerView={5}
    // navigation
    // centeredSlidesBounds={true}
    // pagination={{ clickable: true }}
    scrollbar={{ draggable: true }}
    onSwiper={(swiper) => console.log(swiper)}
    onSlideChange={() => console.log("slide change")}
    resizeObserver={true} // enable resize observer functionality
  >
    {cardsData.map((card, index) => {
      const iconPath =
        liveTextIconMap[card.liveText as keyof typeof liveTextIconMap];

      const isThirdCard = index === 3;
      const isFourthCard = index === 4;
      const isFifthCard = index === 5 || index === 6;

      if (index === 4) {
        return (
          <SwiperSlide key={index}>
            <FlipCard
              key={index}
              card={card}
              icon={iconPath}
              isOpaque={index < 3}
              isFourth={isFourthCard}
              isFifth={isFifthCard}
              isThird={isThirdCard}
            />
          </SwiperSlide>
        );
      } else {
        return (
          <SwiperSlide key={index}>
            <Card
              key={index}
              {...card}
              icon={iconPath}
              isOpaque={index < 3}
              isFourth={isFourthCard}
              isFifth={isFifthCard}
              isThird={isThirdCard}
            />
          </SwiperSlide>
        );
      }
    })}
  </Swiper>
);
```

I hope these suggestions help you fix your issue. If not, you can check out more resources on the [swiper website](^2^) or the [swiper GitHub repository](^3^). Good luck! ðŸ˜Š
